### Week 01
First of all, I have consultation with **Marie**, where we have discussed my plan for training my AI model, she said that I could try to make the face detecton model first, get accuracy above 90% and then start my face recognition.

Second of all, I spoke to **Frederik**, we have discussed how my database would look like and how to connect to it, he said he will send me some guides on how to implement mySQL database in python.

Third of all, I was talking with **Tijn** about my maker part, where I will use some plywood and apply laser cutting on it, I made another consultation, because I want some help to make a pdf file for laser cutting, so I can come and cut the pieces of my box.
